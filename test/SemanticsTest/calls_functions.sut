Once upon a time in Santadila ...(
  There was Angel.
  Angel brought a bag: soyInt. -- Type Int
  Angel brought a book: soyChar. -- Type Char
  Angel brought a phrase: soyString. -- TypeString

  Once upon some other time in C4R4C4S, there was a book ( made of bag x, your bag termol, wallet termo) ...(
  		Angel brought a bag: hi = 1.
  )... or that is what they say.

  soyInt = C4R4C4S(with 1,2,3.1). -- Le asigno a un Int un Char
  
  soyChar = C4R4C4S(with 1,2,3.1). -- Le asigno a un Char un Char

  soyString = C4R4C4S(with 1,2,3.1). -- Le asigno a un String un Char

)... and they lived happily ever after

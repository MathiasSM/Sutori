Once upon a time in Santadila ...(
  There was Angel, Deamon and iPod.
  Once upon some other time in C4R4C4S, there was a bag ...(
    Angel brought a bag: low = 0.
    Deamon brought a bag: hi = 10000.
    Angel brought a bag: x = 42.
    iPod keeps dreaming of low < hi ...(
      Angel brought a bag: mid = (low + hi) / 2.
      Angel dreams of ...(
        low = mid.
      )... when mid <= x ; otherwise ...(
        hi = mid - 1 .
      )... .
    )... .

  )... or that is what they say.
)... and they lived happily ever after

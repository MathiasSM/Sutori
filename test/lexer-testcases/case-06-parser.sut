Once upon a time in Santadila ...(
  There was Angel, Deamon and iPod.
  Angel brought a bag: low = 0.
  Deamon brought a bag: hi = 10000.
  Angel brought a bag: x = 42.
  x keeps dreaming of low < hi ...(
    Angel brought a bag: mid = (low + hi) / 2.
  )... .
  mid=2.
  hi[3].
  hii[2].
)... and they lived happily ever after

Once upon a time in Santadila ...(
  There was Angel.
  Angel brought a bag: hi,low,fo,low = "askdjlas".
  Angel brought a phrase: as.
  hi = 23.
  fo = 'c'.
  hi = 23.1 and 4.
  low = on + 23 + "hola".
  low = on and off.
  --low = on and "sss".
  --low = "string".
  --Angel brought a chain (of 2 bag) : arr = [1;2].

  Once upon some other time in C4R4C4S, there was a bag ( made of bag x, your bag termol, wallet termo) ...(

  )... or that is what they say.

  as = C4R4C4S(with hi,hi,hi,23.9).
  as = C4R4C4S(with 23.9).
  as = C4R4C4S(with hi,23.9).
  --C4R4C4S(with hi,"string",23.9).
  --C4R4C4S(with hi,hi).


)... and they lived happily ever after

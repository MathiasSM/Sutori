    There was Facto.

    Facto brought a bag: factorial = 1, it = 1.

    ...(
      factorial = factorial * it.
      it = it + 1.
    )... Avery told that story N times.

    And that's where factorial comes from.

  There was Infinity.

  Infinity brought a phrase: answer.
  Infinity brought a bag: N.

  Infinity keeps dreaming of 42 ...(
    Infinity: "Do you want to run which factorial? Iterative or recursive? [i/r/N]"
    answer?

    There was Reporter.
    Infinity dreams of ...(
      Reporter: iterfacto(N).
